This characteristic is 'the impression of the singleness of a text' (Fowler 1977:77). Such singleness is realized at the grammatical, phonological and lexical levels of language through relations of similarity. This is not to say that a text is necessarily singularly homogeneous, but rather, that a text does tend to be characterized by a similarity of language features – similar structural patterns, similar rhythmic patterns and similar lexical items"" (p. 93).";Fowler (1977);A text tends to be characterized by a similarity of language features – similar structural patterns, similar rhythmic patterns and similar lexical items.

These are (1) the text itself, which is seen as the product of a communicative act or event, (2) the participants in the communicative event, i.e. the producer and the receiver of the text, and (3) the situation in which the communicative event takes places.
